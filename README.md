# Proportional Odds Logistics Regression in R
##### _also called "Ordered Logit Model"_

See the HTML page here :arrow_right:   [link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/walthersy/OddsRegression/blob/main/odds_model.html)

This model predicts the odds of variables that has an order to it. In this case, the model is estimating whether an individual:
- Will likely make no changes.. 
- Will only make a few changes..
- Will make some changes..
- Will make a lot of changes..  

..with regards to the way these individuals live and work in order to reduce the impact of global climate change.


## Questions:

:point_right: Do you find evidence that preparedness to make sacrifices to reduce the effects of climate change varies with the party preferences of the individual? If your answer is 'yes', then which party affiliations are most strongly related to the probability that a person is willing to make a lot of changes, and which party affiliations are most strongly related to the probability that a person is not willing to make any changes?  

:point_right: Is preparedness to make changes related to age? If so, are old people more or less likely to be prepared to make changes than young people?  

:point_right: Are men more willing to make changes than women?  

:point_right: Consider a randomly chosen 60 year old male who identifies most closely with the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN). What is the probability that this person would not be prepared to make any changes to the way he lived and worked in order to reduce the impact of global climate change?
